    "**Reflection:** The most difficult concept for me in this assignment was recursion. Because I noticed that there was a Trip nested within another Trip, I thought recursion would be the best approach to create a function that is general and could be used for a json file with even deeper nested Trips. In 601, I used recursion to create a function that creates all possible integer coordinates of a (n,d) grid. This experience allowed me to extrapolate the idea of recursion to the problem for this assignment. However, smoothing out the specifics of the function took some time for me."
